Multi-stage image denoising and image super-resolution using convolutional neural networks
The app is very simple and not particularly effective. 
We target images with typical noise in low light situations. 
To brighten and denoise we do the following:
1.Luminance enhancement we use histogram equalization
2.In order to remove the more powerful noise, we use median filtering in the image generation process
3.For better super-resolution, we added the option to sharpen the image or not.
